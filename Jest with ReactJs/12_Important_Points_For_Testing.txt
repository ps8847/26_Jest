1) what we should test ? 

    Testing component rendering 
    Ui elements that we write 
    fucntions which we write 
    Api Testing
    Eevent Testing 
    Props and states 
    Ui condition testing | UI state Testing

2) what things we should not test ? 

    external ui library code 
    no need to test default fucntion of js and react 
    sometime we should mock fucntion rather than testing it in details 

3) imporant points ?

    do not write snapshots in starting ofd the project 
    run test case after completing your functionlaity 
    make aa standard for code coverage
