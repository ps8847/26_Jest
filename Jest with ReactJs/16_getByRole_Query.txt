1) What is the Role in getByRole?

The "role" in getByRole refers to the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) role assigned to a specific element. These roles define what kind of user interface element a particular HTML element represents (e.g., a button, a checkbox, a heading). The role attribute helps assistive technologies, such as screen readers, understand and navigate the content of web pages.
For example:
A <button> element has the role of "button".
A <h1> element has the role of "heading".
An <input type="text"> element has the role of "textbox".

2) What are Semantic Elements?

Semantic elements are HTML elements that have a meaning or purpose clearly defined by the element itself. These elements describe their meaning in a way that both the browser and the developer can understand, which improves accessibility and SEO.
Examples of Semantic Elements:
<button>: Represents a clickable button.
<h1>, <h2>, etc.: Represent headings of different levels.
<table>: Represents tabular data.
Non-Semantic Elements:
<div>: A generic container with no inherent meaning.
<span>: A generic inline container with no inherent meaning.
Non-semantic elements are used purely for layout or styling purposes, whereas semantic elements clearly convey the intended purpose or function to both browsers and assistive technologies.
