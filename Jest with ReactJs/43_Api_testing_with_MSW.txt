1) install msw >> npm install msw --save-dev
2) make mock service folder 
3) make server file 
4) make server handler filer    >> make folder as follows  

                            -- src /
                                -- mockServices /
                                    -- handler.js 
                                    -- server.js

5) write code for api testing  >>  in the folder 


( we will create a nodejs project and will perform it there because tetsing mocks in bakcend is preferred more)

6) call server in test setup file  >> in the folder of 01     ( to run that go to the root of that folder and type  == node ./src/index.js)
