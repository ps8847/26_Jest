Understand React test Structure 

1) what needs to import : minimum we need to import {render , screen} from @testing-library/react
2) how to render the component : by using the render function and providing the component we want to test
3) how tests working with RTL : it will check if the thing exist on our screen then pass else fail 
4) how test finding UI elements  :  by following kind of fucntion 

        import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
        import App from './App';

        test('renders learn react link', () => {
            render(<App />);
            const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
            expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
        });
