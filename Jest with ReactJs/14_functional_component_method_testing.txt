1) discuss possible case for method tetsing 

    firing the event , test the ui elements 
    not need to test the methods/fucntions .. if need the can with a long approach
    
2) define the button  ,  click event and method 
3) test method with event          >> in folder ( 01 )
4) test method without event    

    1) firts method is dont test these methods 
    2) make it a class component then test 
    3) if we wnat to test method like this  

        function App() {

            let handleOtherMethod = () => {
                console.log("hi");
                return "hi";
            }

            return (
                <div className="App">
                </div>
            )
        }
    
     >> in folder ( 02 )
